Practice Problems
=================
This is a collection of algorithm and data structure practice problems along
with my solutions. Language does not matter. Some will probably be in Ruby, 
while others may be in Java or Python for variety.

almost-twins
------------
Given a binary search tree and a value X, find the node with value immediately
greater than X.

more-than-perms
---------------
Given a set of letters and a length N, produce all possible output. (Not permutation).
For example, give the letter `(p,o)` and length of `3`, produce the following
output(in any order you want, not just my example order):

    ppp ppo poo pop opp opo oop ooo

Another example would be given `(a,b)` and length `2`:

    ab aa bb ba


sum-of-evil
-----------
Given a number, come up with all of the possible ways to insert `+` and `-` in
that number. For example, given `123`, possible output would be:

    1+23 
    1+2+3
    1-23
    1-2+3
    1-2-3
    1+2-3
    12+3
    12-3
