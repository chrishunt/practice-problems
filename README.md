Practice Problems
=================
This is a collection of algorithm and data structure practice problems along
with my solutions. Language does not matter. Some will probably be in Ruby, 
while others may be in Java or Python for variety.

Given a number, come up with all of the possible ways to insert `+` and `-` in
that number. For example, given `123`, possible output would be:

    1+23 
    1+2+3
    1-23
    1-2+3
    1-2-3
    1+2-3
    12+3
    12-3
